# OpenGL Fractal Animation Sample

## About the Project

This is a 3D animation that I programmed in C++ with OpenGL. It uses glad, irKlang, stb, and glfw libraries along with a little math to develop the coordinates for some visually interesting shapes. I have added the Cmakelists.txt for cross-platfrom development as well as source.cpp and objects.cpp for reference.
